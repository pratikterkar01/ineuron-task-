1.	Create an assert statement that throws an AssertionError if the variable spam is a negative integer.
Ans= assert(spam<0,”the spam is –ve”)

2.	Write an assert statement that triggers an AssertionError if the variables eggs and bacon contain strings that are the same as each other, even if their cases are different (that is, 'hello' and 'hello' are considered the same, and 'goodbye' and 'GOODbye' are also considered the same).
Ans=   eggs=”hello”
           Bacon=”goodbye”
            assert eggs.lower() != bacon.lower(), 'eggs/bacon should not be the same!'
3.	Create an assert statement that throws an AssertionError every time.
Ans=assert True, 'Always triggers an AssertionError.' 
4.	What are the two lines that must be present in your software in order to call logging.debug()?
Ans= import logging 
          Loging.basicConfig(filename=”logging.txt”,level=loging.Debug,format=%(astime)s-%(levelname)s-%(time)s)

5.	What are the two lines that your program must have in order to have logging.debug() send a logging message to a file named programLog.txt?
Ans=

6.	What are the five levels of logging?
 DEBUG, INGO, WARNING, ERROR and CRITICAL

7.	What line of code would you add to your software to disable all logging messages?
Log=logging.getLogger(“looger”)
Log.propogate()=False

8.Why is using logging messages better than using print() to display the same message?
Ans= print don’t have console access ,logging message can be stored in the some other file

9.What are the differences between the Step Over, Step In, and Step Out buttons in the debugger?
Step - one line execution at a time
 Over - excecute the next line of code, but if it is a program, it will
              complete the entire function call.
 out  - execute the lines of code unti it returns from the current function.
   
10.After you click Continue, when will the debugger stop ?
Until program stops

11. What is the concept of a breakpoint?
Ans = that allows developers to set points in code at which a debugger is called
