1. What exactly is []?
Ans = this indicates the sign of list. 


2. In a list of values stored in a variable called spam, how would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value? (Assume [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] are in spam.)
Spam[2]=”hello”

Let's pretend the spam includes the list ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] for the next three queries.

3. What is the value of spam[int(int('3' * 2) / 11)]?
It gives the calue of 1st value in spam list =a


4. What is the value of spam[-1]?
It gives the last value of the list=d

5. What is the value of spam[:2]?
It shows 1st two values of the list =a,b
Let's pretend bacon has the list [3.14, 'cat,' 11, 'cat,' True] for the next three questions.

6. What is the value of bacon.index('cat')?
Ans=1

7. How does bacon.append(99) change the look of the list value in bacon?
Ans=[3.14, 'cat,' 11, 'cat,' True,99]

8. How does bacon.remove('cat') change the look of the list in bacon?
[3.14,' 11, 'cat,' True,99]

9. What are the list concatenation and list replication operators?
Concatenation means adding the two list values
Replication give the ,how many time the value repeated

10. What is difference between the list methods append() and insert()?
Append()  add element at the end of the list but inser() add the value at the specific positon

11. What are the two methods for removing items from a list?
Remove() and pop()

12. Describe how list values and string values are identical.
Because the indexing of the both are same ,both are in a sequence

13. What's the difference between tuples and lists?
Tuples are immutable and list are mutable

14. How do you type a tuple value that only contains the integer 42?
     Ans=  a=(42)

15. How do you get a list value's tuple form? How do you get a tuple value's list form?
An itterable  list can be converted into tuple using tuple(),
By looping the tuple and using the append.list we get the values from the tuple as list


16. Variables that "contain" list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, what do they contain?
Instead of list it can be string or integer

17. How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?
Copy.copy() it creates a copy and make changes in original also at a time.
But in copy.deepcopy() it copy the original and it is independent on the original and original not change
