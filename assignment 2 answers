1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
Ans= there are two values of Boolean data type “true” and “false”.
          It is releted to the statement or expression that we need to check.if it is correct then “true” printed and if false then “false”.

a=True
b=False
print(a)
print(b)

2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
Ans- AND,OR , NOT these are 3 type of of Boolean data type . it is used  to comparing

3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluate ).
AND                                                             
	
T	T	T
F	F	F
T	F	T
F	T	T

or table
F	F	F
T	T	T
T	F	F
F	T	F

not 
T	F
F	T



T=TRUE
F=FALSE




4. What are the values of the following expressions?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)
=FALSE
not (5 > 4)
=FALSE
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)
=TRUE
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))
=FALSE
(True and True) and (True == False)
=FALSE
(not False) or (not True)
=TRUE
5. What are the six comparison operators?
<=,=>,==,!=,<,>
6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a condition and when you would use one.
= assignmen operator is used to assigning value to the variable but equal to operator(==) is used for comparison 
7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
print('eggs')
if spam > 5:
print('bacon')
else:
print('ham')
print('spam')
print('spam')
ans= 
     ham
     spam
      spam

8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.
spam=1
if spam==1:
              print(“hello”)
if spam==2:
             print(“Howdy”)
else:
          print(“Greetings”)
            

9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys you’ll press?
Ctrl + c
10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
Break is used to stop the particular loop when condition is specified but continue continues the loop by skiping thet stuck part
11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
range(10)=we start loop from starting zero.
Range(0,10)=it gives initiation to the loop.
Range(0,10,1)= it gives the difference between two output
12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.

1.For i in range(1,11):
                Print(i)

2. a= 0
 While a<10:
    a+=1
print(a) 

13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?
   Spam.bacon()
